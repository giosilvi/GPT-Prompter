# GPT-Prompter
Chrome extension to get a fast explanation/prompts of the selected text using GPT-3. Available in the chrome web store

To use it follows these steps:

1- Add the extension from the Chrome Web store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gpt-prompter/lcgpdbficokndjodlcgflbhaibicompp

2- If you don`t have it already, make a profile at OpenAI https://beta.openai.com/

3- From https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys you can copy your API Key and paste into the chrome extension (we never have access to your API Key, it is stored on your Chrome profile).

4- You are set to go! Now just select text from a website and select from the right-click menu the GPT-Prompter command to send the custom prompt with the selected text. 

5- The default prompt available is "Tell me more about <selected text>" but you can create anything you want with just the constrain that it has to contain a field for the selected text.
